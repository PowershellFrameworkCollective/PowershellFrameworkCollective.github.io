# Utility
## Synopsis

Utility is the catch-all category for individual commands that do not fit into any more specific category or would be a category ontu themselves.

## Commands

### Select-PSFObject

`Select-PSFObject` completely replaces `Select-Object`, offering all of its functionality, but offering greater input comfort and more readable code by avoiding hashtables for simple operations. It also adds the ability to extend an object, rather than building a new object, fully replacing `Add-Member`.
