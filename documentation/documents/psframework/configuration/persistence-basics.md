# Persistence: Basics
## Synopsis

Covers the basics of how configuration settings can be persisted.

## Description
### The Three Types Of Persistence

Settings can be stored in three kinds of locations:

 - Settings that will be automatically imported when loading the `PSFramework` module for the first time.
These can be stored in both registry or file, can be per user or computer-wide.
 - Settings that are explicitly read and written by a module, but stored in a specific path.
 - You can manually pick a location to export to/import from.

### Simply remember a setting
