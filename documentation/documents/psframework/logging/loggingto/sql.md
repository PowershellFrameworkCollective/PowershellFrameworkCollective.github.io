## Generating Messages

You can write messages using the `Write-PSFMessage` cmdlet, which functionally replaces Write-Verbose, Write-Host, Write-Warning, Write-Debug or Write-Log:

```powershell
# Verbose
Write-PSFMessage -Message "Test Message"

# Host
Write-PSFMessage -Level Host -Message "Message visible to the user"

# Debug
Write-PSFMessage -Level Debug -Message "Very well hidden message"

# Warning
Write-PSFMessage -Level Warning -Message "Warning Message"
```

You can also add tags for better filtering:

```powershell
Write-PSFMessage -Message "Tagged Message" -Tag special, custom, whatever
```

Specify the target you are working against to better track actions relating to that specific target:

```powershell
Write-PSFMessage -Message "Doing something" -Target $ComputerName
```
