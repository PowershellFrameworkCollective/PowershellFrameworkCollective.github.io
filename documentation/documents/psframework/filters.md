# Filters

[Back to PSFramework](https://psframework.org/documentation/documents/psframework.html)

## Synopsis

The filter system in PSFramework allows developers to implement their own filter expression syntaxes.
This allows enabling users to define filter conditions in a user friendly manner.

It also allows defining and using flexible logical evaluation in data sections without risking unintended code execution, making these filter expressions perfectly safe to use in data documents.
