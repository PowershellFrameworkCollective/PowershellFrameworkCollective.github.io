## PARAMETERS

### -Options
The options the user may pick from.
The user selects a choice by specifying the letter associated with a choice.
The letter assigned to a choice is picked from the character after the first '&' in any specified string.
If there is no '&', the system will automatically pick the first letter as choice letter:
"This &is an example" will have the character "i" bound for the choice.
"This is &an example" will have the character "a" bound for the choice.
"This is an example" will have the character "T" bound for the choice.

This parameter takes both strings and hashtables (in any combination).
A hashtable is expected to have two properties, 'Label' and 'Help'.
Label is the text shown in the initial prompt, help what the user sees when requesting help.
