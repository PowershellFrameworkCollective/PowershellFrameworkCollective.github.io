# Remove-PSFConfig

## SYNOPSIS
Removes configuration items from memory.

## SYNTAX

### Default
```
Remove-PSFConfig [[-Config] <Config[]>] [[-FullName] <String[]>] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### Name
```
Remove-PSFConfig [-Module] <String> [[-Name] <String>] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
This command removes configuration items from memory.
However, not all settings can just be deleted!
A configuration item must be flagged as deletable.
This can be done using Set-PSFConfig -AllowDelete or Import-PSFConfig -AllowDelete.
Certain schema versions of configuration json may also support defining this in the file.

Limitations to flagging configuration as deletable:
\> Once a configuration item has been initialized, its deletable status is frozen.
  The last time it is possible to change the deletable status is during initialization.
\> A setting that has been set as mandated by policy cannot be removed.

Reason for this limit:
The configuration system is designed for multiple scenarios.
Deleting settings makes sense in some, while in others it is actually detrimental.
Initialization is especially designed for the module scenario, where the module's configuration is its options menu.
In this scenario, having a user deleting settings could lead to broken execution and unintended code paths, that might be at odds with policies defined.

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1
```
Remove-PSFConfig -FullName 'Phase1.Step1.Server' -Confirm:$false
```

Deletes the setting 'Phase1.Step1.Server' from memory, assuming it exists and supports deletion.
