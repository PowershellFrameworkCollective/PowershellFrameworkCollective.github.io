# Install-PSFLoggingProvider

## SYNOPSIS
Installs a logging provider for the PSFramework.

## SYNTAX

```
Install-PSFLoggingProvider [[-Name] <String>] [-EnableException] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
This command installs a logging provider registered with the PSFramework.

Some providers may require special installation steps, that cannot be handled by the common initialization / configuration.
For example, a provider may require installation of binaries that require elevation.

In order to cover those scenarios, a provider can include an installation script, which is called by this function.
It can also provide additional parameters to this command, which are dynamically provided once the -Name parameter has been passed.

When registering the logging provider (Using Register-PSFLoggingProvider), you can specify the logic executed by this command with these parameters:
- IsInstalledScript :      Must return $true when installation has already been performed.
If this returns not $false, then this command will do nothing at all.
- InstallationScript :     The script performing the actual installation
- InstallationParameters : A script that returns dynamic parameters.
This can be used to generate additional parameters that can modify the installation process.

NOTE:
This module does not contain help/guidance on how to generate dynamic parameters!
