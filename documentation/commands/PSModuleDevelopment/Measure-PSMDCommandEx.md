# Measure-PSMDCommandEx

## SYNOPSIS
Measures command performance with consecutive tests.

## SYNTAX

```
Measure-PSMDCommandEx [-ScriptBlock <ScriptBlock>] [-Iterations <Int32>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
This function measures the performance of a scriptblock many consective times.

Warning: Running a command repeatedly may not yield reliable information, since repeated executions may benefit from caching or other performance enhancing features, depending on the script content.
This is best suited for measuring the performance of tasks that will later be run repeatedly as well.
It also is useful for mitigating local performance fluctuations when comparing performances.

PARAMETER ScriptBlock
The scriptblock whose performance is to be measure.

PARAMETER Iterations
How many times should this performance test be repeated.

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1
```
Measure-PSMDCommandEx -ScriptBlock { dir \\Server\share } -Iterations 100
```

This tries to use Get-ChildItem on a remote directory 100 consecutive times, then measures performance and reports common performance indicators (Average duration, Maximum, Minimum, Total)

## PARAMETERS

### -Iterations
How many times should this performance test be repeated.
